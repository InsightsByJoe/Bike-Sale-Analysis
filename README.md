# Bike Sale Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bike sales based on various demographics and factors, including **home ownership**, **age bracket**, **gender**, and **region**. The dataset includes multiple variables that offer insights into the purchasing behavior of different segments of the population.

Through this analysis, we aim to uncover trends and patterns in bike purchases across different customer groups. Additionally, this project explores the correlation between occupation, income, and bike ownership status. The results from this analysis provide valuable insights for stakeholders interested in bike sales demographics.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project can be sourced from the following links:
- GitHub Link: [Excel Project Dataset](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx)

## Tools Used
For the data analysis and visualization, the following tool was used:
- **Microsoft Excel** (Download from: [Download here](https://microsoft.com))

## Process
### Data Loading and Inspection
- The data was loaded from the provided links and inspected for completeness.
- A quick overview of the dataset was done to check the shape and dimensions (rows, columns).
- We used Excelâ€™s **Pivot Tables** and other analysis tools to inspect the data and begin our analysis.

### Data Cleaning
- **Duplicates**: Duplicate records were identified and removed.
- **Missing Values**: Any missing data points were checked and filled where possible, while records with critical missing information were omitted.

### Transformations
- **IF Statements**: We applied **IF Statements** to categorize:
  - **Marital Status** (e.g., single, married).
  - **Gender** (e.g., male, female).
  - **Age Bracket** (e.g., young, middle age, old).
  
  These transformations enabled us to create more meaningful categories for analysis.

## Analysis and Findings
Several key findings were discovered during the analysis:
1. **Bike Purchases by Home Ownership**:
   - Customers who owned homes were more likely to purchase bikes.
   - There was a noticeable difference between homeowners and non-homeowners in bike purchases, with homeowners leading significantly.

2. **Bike Purchases by Region**:
   - North America had the highest bike purchases, followed by Pacific and Europe regions.
   - Regional purchasing behavior is affected by cultural and economic factors, with North America having a stronger preference for bikes.

3. **Bike Purchases by Age Bracket**:
   - Middle-aged individuals had the highest bike purchase rate, followed by older age groups.
   - Younger individuals purchased fewer bikes, possibly due to financial limitations or different transportation preferences.

4. **Average Income by Occupation**:
   - There is a strong correlation between higher income occupations (e.g., management and professional roles) and bike purchases.
   - Clerical and manual occupations showed lower bike purchase rates.

### Recommendations
- **Targeted Marketing**: The analysis suggests that marketing efforts should be focused on homeowners, middle-aged individuals, and regions with higher income occupations.
- **Regional Expansion**: Expand sales efforts in regions with high purchase potential (e.g., North America), but also consider offering incentives or campaigns in lower-performing regions like Europe.
- **Income-based Campaigns**: Focus on targeting high-income individuals and occupations with more disposable income.

### Limitations
- The dataset does not cover all global regions, limiting the generalizability of the results.
- Some variables, such as personal preferences or geographic conditions (e.g., bike-friendly cities), were not included in the dataset and could affect bike purchasing behavior.
  
### Conclusion
This analysis of bike sales data provides valuable insights into purchasing behavior across various demographics. By leveraging this data, stakeholders can optimize their marketing and sales strategies to target the right customers in the right regions.
